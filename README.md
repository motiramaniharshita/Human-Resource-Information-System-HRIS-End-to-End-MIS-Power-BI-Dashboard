📖 Project Purpose

This project builds a Unified Human Resources Information System (HRIS) that integrates multiple HR functions—Recruitment, Onboarding, Training, Promotions, and Exits—into one centralized MySQL database. It automates critical HR processes with triggers, ensures data consistency with constraints, and provides interactive Power BI dashboards for actionable managerial insights.

The system simulates how a company with 2,000+ employees across multiple locations can transition from siloed HR data to a single, automated, data-driven decision-making platform.
